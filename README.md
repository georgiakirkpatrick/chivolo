*Planning the MVP*

I will only build the high-priority features for the MVP.  I can add medium- and low-priority features later.

From Assignment 11.3 (link), here are the high-priority features for the KidTube app:

As a new user and parent, I want to use the app without setting up an account.  High priority.
As a kid, I want a random video to load automatically and start playing.  High priority.
As a kid, I want to skip to the next video.  High priority.

Here are the medium- and low-priority features to keep in mind while building the MVP, although I won't build them yet:

As a new user and parent, I want to set up a parent account. Medium priority.
As a returning user and parent, I want to block content I don't like.  Medium priority.
As a returning user and parent, I want to see what my kid has watched.  Medium priority.
As a returning user and parent, I want to set a timer that locks the app after the amount of time I specify.  Medium priority.
As a kid, I want to pause a video.  Medium priority.
As a kid, I want to play the video of my choice.  Medium priority.
As a kid, I want the app to recommend new, unwatched videos for me to watch.  Medium priority.
As a kid, I want to see an overview of which shows are available.  Medium priority.
As a kid, I want to choose an episode of the show I choose.  Medium priority.

As a new user and parent, I want to set up a user profile for each of my kids who will use the app. Low priority.
As a kid, I want to see my watch history. Low priority.

Here are the shows in YouTube I'd like to include in my app:
